You know just how much of an icon he is in the gaming industry. If you’re not familiar with the history, you must have wondered at some point “Why is this guy so popular?” The answer, my friend, is Metal Gear.\\n\\nKojima’s popularity and renown can be traced to a game series that forever revolutionized the medium, brought certain conventions that have essentially become laws, and a plot so complex it took the world years to finally understand. With the Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake right around the corner, this is your cue to explore this legendary series if you haven’t and join the cult.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nMetal Gear Solid Delta Looks Incredible\\n\\nTaking “Staying True To The Original” To The Extreme\\n\\nAlright, You Can Have Your Filter\\n\\nI’m Keeping My Fingers Crossed, Konami\\n\\nMetal Gear Solid Delta Looks Incredible\\n\\nAs religiously as I’ve played the Metal Gear series, the prospect of getting to play the overwhelming MGS3 once again was an indescribable feeling of joy. However, logic soon took over and I realized that Konami was no longer what it was, so I shouldn’t get my hopes up. This company has absolutely ruined Metal Gear, Silent Hill, and more with the pachinko nonsense. Why should I trust it now?\\n\\nI don’t want Konami Metal Gear.\\n\\nby\\n\\nu/JamPilotKnight in\\n\\nmetalgearsolid\\n\\nStill, Metal Gear Solid 3 was too much of a strong allure, and I couldn’t help but get attracted. Along came the Xbox showcase with the brilliant MGS3 trailer. By the time it finished, it had completely won me over.\\n\\nFirst, let me just say how much of an emotional ride and sentimental blow it was to see this unrivaled masterpiece look so visually stunning. I got teary-eyed to see how far we had come. I still remember playing this for the first time and getting surprised. Now, I can relive all those iconic moments but in extreme, photorealistic detail.\\n\\nAfter I finished fawning over the visuals, I shifted my attention to the gameplay. And I must say, the vastly improved gameplay had me falling in love all over. It’s Metal Gear Solid 3 with MGS 5-style gameplay and a stunning graphical overhaul, can you even blame me? The addition of crouched movement may break the game, but as long as the AI is modified accordingly, I think this new gameplay direction will be a massive treat.\\n\\nGameplay look at Metal Gear Solid 3: Delta.\\n\\nLooks SICK.#Xbox #XboxShowcase pic.twitter.com/OHX33GbaXG\\n\\n— Shinobi602 (@shinobi602) June 9, 2024\\n\\nTaking “Staying True To The Original” To The Extreme\\n\\nAfter all this, you must be wondering “They’ve changed the game a lot, what if it loses its charm?” To this, I’ll simply reply, Rest assured. Other than the visual overhaul and the gameplay modifications as per the necessity of a remake, it’s as much MGS3 as you remember, down to the finest of the details.\\n\\nIf there’s one thing this trailer confirmed, it’s how much of a Metal Gear Solid 3 fan the devs are. Kojima may be gone, but some good people remain it seems. Their commitment to keeping the remake as true to the original as possible is downright shocking.\\n\\nI love Kojima and hate what Konami did to him, but Delta isnt being made by those corporate people, its being made by hardworking game devs…\\n\\nby\\n\\nu/Due-Revolution-9379 in\\n\\nmetalgearsolid\\n\\nFrom big things like the iconic cutscenes and scenarios from the original like the swamp mission, to little details like Snake shouting when unloading the M63, it’s Metal Gear Solid 3 just as you remember. They left major scenes and encounters unchanged; the trailer makes sure to establish that you’ll always know it’s MGS 3, just visually a lot more impactful.\\n\\nSpeaking of staying true to the original, the remake even uses the original sound recording as it is. You must have noticed this from the trailer too, but the sounds are exactly the same, lifted from the original unaltered. You get to listen to David Hayter’s legendary voice once again, it’s like you’re back in the glory days of Konami and Metal Gear. Man, I love just how much of a throwback this remake is to the original.\\n\\nThe story and character voices in METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER remain the same from the original game.\\n\\n#MetalGearSolid\\n\\n#MGSDelta\\n\\n#MG35th\\n\\npic.twitter.com/WoyCoDOydM\\n\\n— METAL GEAR OFFICIAL (@Metalgear) May 25, 2023\\n\\nOh, and I think The Boss’ redesign is very fitting, and so is Snake’s. I don’t know what the complaints even wanted.\\n\\nAlright, You Can Have Your Filter\\n\\nI know what you’re thinking, I had the same thought watching the trailer. “Ain’t no Metal Gear Solid 3 without the piss filter,” am I right? Jokes aside, the atmospheric post-processing of that era created a yellowish-green tinge in the games, a relic of technologically limited times. However, they’ve essentially become a part of the experience for those who enjoyed gaming back then.\\n\\nThus, seeing Metal Gear Solid 3 and all its iconic characters and cutscenes without the yellow filter was kind of odd. Like something integral was missing.\\xa0I’m just kidding, The Metal Gear Solid 3 remake looks incredible with or without it. However, it seems the devs took the “bring back the piss filter” demands a little too seriously.\\n\\nAdded a little piss-filter and bloom to the MGS3 remake trailer\\n\\nby\\n\\nu/DarioxSulvan in\\n\\nmetalgearsolid\\n\\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will have an option that turns on the yellowish filter to ensure a more realistic MGS 3 experience, for all you elitists out there (deep down, I’m that elitist). So, if you even slightly meant it when you asked for the filter, rejoice for it has become a reality.\\n\\nI’m Keeping My Fingers Crossed, Konami\\n\\nIn a nutshell, I’m extremely excited about revisiting Metal Gear Solid 3.\\xa0However, no matter how much I try, I can shake off the feeling that Konami will mess it up somehow. This is the present Konami we’re talking about. Pachinkos, NFTs, microtransactions, you name whatever money-making scheme you can think of, Konami has done it. With all the brilliant IPs that it has ruined over the years, even hoping for something good scares me.\\n\\nStill, I’m a firm believer in second chances. If Konami delivers a final product as impressive as this trailer, it can take a solid step toward redemption.\\n\\nDid you find this helpful? Leave feedback below.\\n\\nThanks!
